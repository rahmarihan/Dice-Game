# I'll Guess Your Number

An interactive number guessing game where the **computer guesses the number you're thinking of**. You guide the game by telling the computer if its guess is too high or too low, and it keeps narrowing the range until it finds the correct number.

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- JavaScript
- Expo (React Native)

## 🕹️ How It Works

You think of a number, and the computer tries to guess it. After each guess, you tell it whether the number is higher or lower, and it keeps adjusting its guess accordingly until it gets it right.

The game also displays a history of previous guesses (e.g., _First guess: 50_, _Second guess: 75_, etc.).

This behavior is also shown clearly in the screenshots below.
